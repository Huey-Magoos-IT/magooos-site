=== PROJECT ARCHITECTURE ===
[Next.js 14] client/src/app/
  - App Router: dashboardWrapper.tsx + layout.tsx
  - Dynamic views: /projects/[id]/page.tsx

=== AWS SERVICE MAP ===
Frontend:
Amplify (CI/CD) → S3 (assets) ↔ CloudFront

Backend:
EC2 (auto-scaled) ←→ RDS (VPC)
  ↑          ↓
 Cognito   Lambda (cron/users)
  │          │
 API Gateway ←─┘

=== CRITICAL CODE PATTERNS ===
1. Priority Routing System:
   - client/src/app/priority/[level]/page.tsx
   - Reusable template: reusablePriorityPage/index.tsx

2. Component Architecture:
   - Modal system: ModalNewProject ↔ ModalNewTask
   - View components: BoardView ↔ taskController.ts

3. Security Implementation:
   - server/prisma/schema.prisma: RBAC models
   - client/.env.local: Amplify config
   - server/ecosystem.config.js: PM2 hardening

AWS Infrastructure:
- EC2 auto-scaling groups for backend API
- RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas and daily backups
- S3 buckets with versioning and access logging
- Cognito user pools with custom attributes
- API Gateway with rate limiting
- Lambda functions for cron jobs and user management
- CloudWatch monitoring and alerting

Development Ecosystem:
- CI/CD pipelines with Amplify and GitHub Actions
- Infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) for AWS resources
- Local development environment with Docker
- Automated testing with Jest and Cypress
- Error tracking with Sentry integration
- Documentation system with architecture diagrams

=== AWS OPERATIONAL DETAILS ===

Network Architecture:
- Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnets
- NAT Gateway in public subnet for Lambda outbound traffic
- Internet Gateway for public subnet access
- Private subnets route through NAT Gateway (0.0.0.0/0)
- Security groups with least-privilege access:
  * EC2: Inbound from API Gateway
  * RDS: Inbound from EC2 only
  * Lambda: Outbound through NAT Gateway
  * NAT Gateway: No inbound, all outbound

EC2 Configuration:
- Amazon Linux AMI with PM2 process management
- Security hardening: SSH only via IAM keys, weekly AMI updates
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics

RDS Security:
- Private subnet placement with encrypted storage
- Daily automated backups retained for 35 days
- Connection limits and query timeouts
- Security group allows access only from EC2 instances

Lambda Configuration:
- VPC-enabled for RDS access
- Private subnet placement with NAT Gateway access
- Cognito triggers for user management
- Security group allows outbound HTTPS (443)
- IAM role with VPC execution permissions

Cognito Integration:
- Frontend uses AWS Amplify UI components
- API Gateway Cognito authorizers for all endpoints
- JWT tokens required with 1-hour expiration
- Post-confirmation Lambda syncs users to RDS
- MFA enforcement for admin users

S3 Configuration:
- Versioned buckets with access logging
- Lifecycle policies transitioning to Glacier after 30 days
- CORS rules for frontend access
- Bucket policies restricting uploads to authenticated users

IAM Policies:
- EC2: S3 write access, Cognito admin privileges
- Lambda: RDS read/write access, VPC execution
- Amplify: CodeCommit pull access

Monitoring:
- CloudWatch alarms for:
  - API 5xx errors > 1%
  - RDS CPU > 75%
  - S3 bucket size > 80% capacity
- Daily service health reports
- Lambda execution logs and metrics

=== TECHNICAL STACK ===
Frontend:
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Tailwind CSS + Material UI components
- Drag-and-drop functionality with react-dnd
- Charting with Recharts

Backend:
- Node.js/Express REST API
- Prisma for database management
- JWT authentication
- AWS SDK integrations

DevOps:
- PostgreSQL on AWS RDS
- EC2 for backend hosting
- S3 for file storage
- Cognito for user authentication
- PM2 process management

=== EC2 SETUP AND MAINTENANCE ===

Initial Setup:
1. Connect to EC2 Instance:
   - Use EC2 Instance Connect
   - Instance IP: 3.15.240.21
   - Security Groups: huey_ec2-sg (ports 22, 80, 443)

2. Node.js Installation:
   ```bash
   sudo su -
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
   nvm install node
   ```

3. Git and Repository Setup:
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install git -y
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd magooos-site/server
   npm install
   ```

4. PM2 Process Management:
   ```bash
   npm i pm2 -g
   # Create ecosystem.config.js
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
   pm2 startup systemd
   ```

Server Configuration:
1. Port Configuration:
   - Express server runs on port 3000
   - NGINX reverse proxy forwards port 80 → 3000
   - Security group allows inbound: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

2. API Gateway Integration:
   - Proxy integration to EC2 public IP (3.15.240.21)
   - {proxy+} resource forwards all paths
   - HTTP integration type with proxy enabled

Maintenance Procedures:
1. Code Updates:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/magooos-site
   git pull origin main
   cd server
   npm install
   pm2 restart all
   ```

2. Server Monitoring:
   ```bash
   pm2 list          # Check process status
   pm2 logs          # View application logs
   pm2 monit         # Monitor CPU/Memory
   ```

3. Common Issues:
   - Port conflicts: Check `netstat -tuln`
   - Process crashes: View logs with `pm2 logs`
   - Permission issues: Verify user ownership

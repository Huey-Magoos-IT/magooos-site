# How to Fix the CORS Error in API Gateway

The error "blocked by CORS policy" means your API Gateway isn't configured to accept requests from your frontend's domain. Hereâ€™s how to fix it for your HTTP API.

## Step 1: Navigate to the API Gateway Console

1.  Open the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2.  Go to the **API Gateway** service.
3.  Find and select your HTTP API, which appears to be `sutpql04fb`.

## Step 2: Configure CORS

1.  In the left-hand navigation pane, under your API's name, click on **CORS**.
2.  You will see a configuration screen. You need to tell it which domains (origins), headers, and methods are allowed. Enter the following values:
    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: `https://master.d25xr2dg5ij9ce.amplifyapp.com`
        *   This is the most critical part. It explicitly tells the browser that your Amplify app is allowed to make requests.
    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Headers**: `Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token`
        *   These are the headers your frontend sends, and the API Gateway needs to know they are allowed. `Authorization` is essential for your Cognito-based security.
    *   **Access-Control-Allow-Methods**: `*`
        *   This allows all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, etc.). You can restrict this to `POST` if you want to be more specific for this endpoint.
    *   **Access-Control-Expose-Headers**: `Content-Length,Content-Type,Date`
    *   **Access-Control-Max-Age**: `300`
        *   This tells the browser to cache the preflight response for 5 minutes (300 seconds), which reduces the number of preflight requests.

## Step 3: Save Your Changes

1.  Click the **Save** button.
2.  API Gateway will automatically add an `OPTIONS` route to your API to handle preflight requests. This is what browsers use to check for CORS permissions before sending the actual `POST` request.

After completing these steps, the CORS error should be resolved. It may take a minute or two for the changes to propagate. You might need to do a hard refresh on your browser page.

This configuration ensures that only your Amplify application can communicate with your API, maintaining the security of your backend.

# Huey Magoo's Reporting Portal: FBC Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Huey Magoo's Reporting Portal! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your account and logging in for the first time.

## Step 1: Receiving Your Welcome Email

After an administrator creates your account, you will receive an email with the subject "Your temporary password for Huey Magoo's Reporting Portal".

This email contains:
- **Your Username**: The username you will use to log in.
- **A Temporary Password**: A one-time password to get you started.
- **A Link to the Portal**: A link to `https://master.d25xr2dg5ij9ce.amplifyapp.com/`.

Here is an example of what the email will look like:

> **Subject: Your temporary password for Huey Magoo's Reporting Portal**
>
> # Welcome to Huey Magoo's Reporting Portal
>
> Your username is {username} and temporary password is {####}.
> You will be prompted to change your Password at first logon.
>
> Please log on to [Visit Huey Magoo's Reporting Portal](https://master.d25xr2dg5ij9ce.amplifyapp.com/)
>
> Thank you and Enjoy,
> Huey Magoo's IT Team

## Step 3: Setting Your Permanent Password

Upon your first successful login with the temporary password, you will be required to set a new, permanent password.

1.  You will be presented with a screen to change your password.
2.  Enter your desired new password in the "New Password" field.
3.  Confirm your new password in the "Confirm Password" field.
4.  Click "Change Password".

**Password Requirements:**
*   At least 8 characters
*   At least one uppercase letter
*   At least one lowercase letter
*   At least one number
*   At least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %)

Once your password has been successfully changed, you will be redirected to the main dashboard.

## Subsequent Logins

For all future logins, you will use your username and your new permanent password.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Incorrect Password/Username**: If you see an error message, double-check that you have entered your username and password correctly. Passwords are case-sensitive.
*   **Haven't received a welcome email?**: Please contact your administrator to ensure an account has been created for you and that the email address on file is correct.
*   **Forgot your password?**: Click the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page to initiate a password reset. _(Note: This functionality may need to be added)_

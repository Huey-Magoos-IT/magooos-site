## **Part 2: Navigating and Using the Portal**

Once you log in, you will see your main dashboard. Here is an overview of each section available to you in the left sidebar.

### **Teams**
This is the first page you will see after logging in. It's a simple page that shows you which team you belong to ("FBC") and a list of the permissions your role has, such as `REPORTING`, `SCANS`, and `LOCATION_ADMIN`. You do not need to take any action on this page.

### **Department: % of Scans**
**Purpose:** This page calculates the percentage of total transactions that included a loyalty card scan, referred to as the **'Scan Rate'**. This metric is used to track how consistently loyalty accounts are being scanned at checkout.

**How to Use This Page:**
1.  **Choose Your Report Type:**
    *   **`Loyalty Scan Summary`**: Shows the overall Scan Rate for each **location**, allowing for comparison across stores.
    *   **`Loyalty Scan Detail`**: Breaks down the Scan Rate by individual **employee** to show their specific performance (Total Checks vs. Loyalty Scans).
    *   **`Rolled Up Summary`**: Provides a long-term average performance for locations over your selected date range, smoothing out daily fluctuations.
2.  **Select Date Range:** Choose from a preset (like "Last 30 Days") or a custom date range.
3.  **Select Locations:** Use the location table on the right to choose the stores for your report. You can use the "Add All" button to include all of your assigned locations.
4.  **Process Data:** Click the **"Process Data"** button to generate your report in the table below.

### **Department: Reporting**
**Purpose:** This page is a security and operations tool designed to help you pinpoint two specific types of transaction anomalies that could indicate employee theft or operational errors.

**How to Use This Page:**
1.  **Choose Your Report Type:**
    *   **`Rewards Red Flag Transactions`**: This report helps find "power users" of loyalty accounts, which can be a sign of misuse. The system counts how many times each loyalty ID is used per day. This report will show you every transaction associated with loyalty IDs that exceed a **"Min Daily Usage Count"** that you can set. For example, setting the count to `3` will find all loyalty accounts used three or more times in one day, which is highly unusual for a regular customer.
    *   **`Rewards Discount without Rewards ID`**: This report is very direct. It searches for every transaction where a loyalty discount was applied, but **no loyalty ID** was attached to the check. This helps you quickly identify discounts that may have been given out improperly, as a loyalty discount should always be tied to a verified loyalty account.
2.  **Select Date Range & Locations** to narrow your investigation.
3.  **Process Data** to run the report and view the results in the table at the bottom of the page.

### **Department: Price Portal**
The Price Portal is where you can view current menu prices for your locations and submit requests for price changes. This is a multi-step process.

**Step 1: Select Your Locations**
*   When you first click on the Price Portal, you will be taken to a location selection page. Choose the store or stores you wish to manage prices for and click "Continue".

**Step 2: Review and Edit Prices**
*   You will now see a large table with all menu items and their current prices at your selected locations.
*   You can filter this view by **Category** (e.g., "Tenders", "Salads") using the dropdown menu.
*   To change a price, simply type the new price in the **'New' column** for that item and location.

**Step 3: Submitting Your Changes**
*   Once you have entered all your desired price changes, click the **"Submit Price Changes"** button at the bottom of the page.
*   Your changes will be validated and submitted for review.

**IMPORTANT: Your Account Will Be Locked After Submission**
*   After you submit a price change report, your access to the Price Portal will be **temporarily locked** to prevent further changes while your report is being processed.
*   You will see a "Price Report In Progress" screen. **This is a normal and expected part of the process.**
*   Your access will be restored automatically once the price changes have been approved and processed by an administrator.

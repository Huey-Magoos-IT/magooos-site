- Walk through the new portal together
- Show you the reporting tools built for FBCs
- Get YOUR feedback on what works and what doesn't
- **Your input is critical** - this is YOUR tool

1. Reports (the heart of the portal)
2. User Management
3. Nice-to-have features

**Not Today:**

# SECTION 1: REPORTS

---

## SLIDE 4: Why Reports Matter
**Title:** Why These Reports?

**The Problem:**
- Loyalty fraud is hard to spot manually
- Tracking scan rates across locations takes time
- You need data to have accountability conversations

**The Solution:**
- Automated anomaly detection
- Quick visibility into location performance
- Employee-level detail when you need it

> *Speaker Note: Let the slide speak. Pause here.*

---

## SLIDE 5: Report #1 - % of Scans
**Title:** Loyalty Scan Tracking

**What it does:**
- Tracks how often loyalty cards are scanned at checkout
- Shows performance by **location** or by **employee**
- Rolled-up view for long-term trends

**Three Views:**
| Report Type | Shows |
|-------------|-------|
| Loyalty Scan Summary | Scan rate per location |
| Loyalty Scan Detail | Scan rate per employee |
| Rolled Up Summary | Long-term averages |

> *Speaker Note: Demo this live. Let them pick a location.*

---

## SLIDE 6: Report #2 - Red Flag Transactions
**Title:** Catching Anomalies

**Rewards Red Flag Transactions:**
- Finds loyalty accounts used suspiciously often
- You set the threshold (e.g., 3+ uses/day = flag)
- Helps identify potential misuse

**Rewards Discount without ID:**
- Finds discounts applied with NO loyalty account
- Direct indicator of possible improper discounts

> *Speaker Note: Explain this is about accountability, not gotcha. These are conversation starters.*

1. Choose your report type

**Title:** Let's Create a User Together

**We'll role-play:**

**Step 1:** User receives verification email
**Step 2:** Clicks "Verify Email" link

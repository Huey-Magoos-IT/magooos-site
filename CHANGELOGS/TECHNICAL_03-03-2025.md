## Location Selection System for Reporting Implementation

### Solution Implemented
Created a new LocationTable component and integrated it with the Reporting Department page to allow admin users to select specific locations for inclusion in data reports, providing more targeted and efficient reporting capabilities.

### Technical Details

#### Component Architecture
1. **LocationTable Component Creation**
   - Developed new component: `client/src/components/LocationTable/index.tsx`
   - Implemented with TypeScript for type safety
   - Used Material UI components for consistent styling
   - Designed with responsive layout and dark mode support
   - Created with sorting and filtering capabilities

2. **Location Data Structure**
   - Defined `Location` interface with required properties:
     - id: string (location identifier)
     - name: string (location name)
     - __typename: string (entity type)
     - createdAt/updatedAt: timestamps
   - Implemented initial dataset with 78 hardcoded locations
   - Structured for future API integration

3. **UI/UX Design**
   - Sortable columns for ID and name
   - Clear visual indicators for hover and selection states
   - Pagination for handling large datasets
   - Status indicators showing count of available locations
   - Optimized scrolling for large location lists

#### Frontend Integration
1. **Reporting Page Updates**
   - Modified `client/src/app/departments/reporting/page.tsx` to integrate LocationTable
   - Implemented location selection and deselection functionality
   - Added visual chips for displaying selected locations
   - Created responsive layout with proper grid organization
   - Enhanced form submission to include selected location IDs

2. **State Management**
   - Implemented React hooks for component state:
     - useState for selection tracking
     - useMemo for optimized filtering and sorting
     - useEffect for lifecycle management
   - Created bidirectional communication between form and table
   - Optimized re-rendering with proper dependency tracking

3. **Form Enhancements**
   - Added clear visual separation between form sections
   - Implemented validation for date ranges and selections
   - Enhanced loading states during report generation
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

### Security Considerations
- Admin-only access to the reporting functionality
- Team-based authorization checks before component rendering
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access attempts
- Secure handling of location IDs in report requests

### Testing Notes
The implementation was tested with the initial hardcoded dataset of 78 locations, confirming proper functionality of location selection, deselection, sorting, and integration with the report generation process. The component correctly filters out already selected locations from the available options and updates the report parameters accordingly.

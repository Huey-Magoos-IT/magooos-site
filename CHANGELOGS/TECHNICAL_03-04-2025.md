## Direct DynamoDB Integration Implementation

### Issue Background
The LocationTable component was previously using hardcoded location data. To improve data accuracy and maintainability, we needed a way to fetch location data directly from a data source without adding AWS SDK dependencies.

### Solution Implemented
Created a direct integration between API Gateway and DynamoDB that allows the frontend to retrieve location data without requiring Lambda functions or AWS SDK, resulting in faster performance and reduced complexity.

### Technical Details

#### AWS Infrastructure Changes
1. **API Gateway DynamoDB Integration**
   - Added new endpoint to existing Lambda API Gateway: `/locations`
   - Method: POST with direct DynamoDB service integration
   - Integration Type: AWS Service (DynamoDB)
   - Action: Scan
   - Resource: Location-u3tk7jwqujcqfedzbv7hksrt4a-NONE table

2. **API Gateway Configuration**
   - Added request mapping template to format DynamoDB Scan operation
   - Added response mapping template to transform DynamoDB response format
   - Configured CORS to allow cross-origin requests
   - Maintained same authorization pattern as other endpoints

3. **IAM Permissions**
   - Added AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess to API Gateway role
   - Restricted permissions to specific DynamoDB table
   - Maintained security best practices with least privilege access

#### Frontend Changes
1. **Lambda API Client Enhancement**
   - Updated `client/src/state/lambdaApi.ts` with new location endpoint
   - Added `getLocations` query using RTK Query
   - Configured proper authentication and error handling
   - Set caching duration to 24 hours for locations data

2. **LocationTable Component Update**
   - Modified `client/src/components/LocationTable/index.tsx` to use dynamic data
   - Replaced hardcoded location data with RTK Query hook
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Enhanced UI feedback for data fetching states
   - Maintained existing sorting and filtering capabilities

3. **Reporting Department Integration**
   - LocationTable now displays actual location data from DynamoDB
   - Maintained existing location selection functionality
   - Improved user experience with real-time data

### Architecture Impact
This implementation enhances the system architecture by:
1. Establishing a pattern for direct DynamoDB access without Lambda or SDK
2. Reducing API call latency by eliminating Lambda cold starts
3. Providing a reusable approach for other simple data access needs
4. Maintaining consistent authentication and security patterns

### Security Considerations
- Authentication is handled through the same Cognito flow as existing endpoints
- Read-only access to the specific DynamoDB table
- Proper error handling to prevent data leakage

### Testing Notes
The implementation has been tested in the Reporting Department page, confirming that location data is successfully retrieved from DynamoDB and properly displayed in the LocationTable component.

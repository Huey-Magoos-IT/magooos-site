- **Purpose**: Displays a sortable table of available locations for selection
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive table with location names and IDs
  - Column sorting (ascending/descending)
  - Search functionality
  - Real-time filtering to exclude already selected locations
  - Responsive design with dark mode support
  - Hover effects for improved user experience

#### 2. Location Type Interfaces
- Defined `Location` interface to standardize location data structure
- Properties include: id, name, createdAt, updatedAt, __typename
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript

### Reporting Department Integration

## Groups Functionality Implementation

### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Groups functionality for location-based access control, allowing admins to create groups of locations and assign LocationAdmin users to manage them.

### Database Changes
- Added new `Group` model with fields:
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `name`: Group name
  - `description`: Optional description
  - `locationIds`: Array of location IDs
  - `createdAt` and `updatedAt`: Timestamps
- Updated `User` model with:
  - `groupId`: Foreign key to Group (for LocationAdmin users)
  - `locationIds`: Array of location IDs the user has access to

### Backend Implementation
- Created GroupController with CRUD operations:
  - `getGroups`: Get all groups (admin) or assigned group (locationAdmin)
  - `createGroup`: Create a new group (admin only)
  - `updateGroup`: Update a group (admin only)
  - `deleteGroup`: Delete a group (admin only)
  - `assignGroupToUser`: Assign a group to a LocationAdmin user (admin only)
  - `getLocationUsers`: Get users for a specific location
- Updated UserController with location management:
  - `updateUserLocations`: Update user's location access
  - `createLocationUser`: Create a new LocationUser with specific location access
- Implemented permission boundaries to ensure users can only access authorized locations
- Used raw SQL queries for complex operations that are difficult to express in Prisma's query language

### Frontend Implementation
- Created GroupCard component for displaying group information
- Implemented Groups management page with:
  - Create/edit/delete functionality for groups
  - User assignment dialog for assigning LocationAdmin users to groups
  - Location selection interface
- Updated API slice with new endpoints for groups and locations
- Added access control utilities for location-based permissions

### Key Features
- Automatic location synchronization for LocationAdmin users
- Permission boundaries for location assignment
- Location-based data filtering
- Group-based access control

### Technical Decisions
- Used array fields for location IDs for flexibility and performance
- Implemented Group-User relationship with a foreign key for clear ownership
- Created a dedicated GroupCard component for specialized UI
- Added strict permission checks in controllers for secure access control
- Used Material UI components for consistent UI with the rest of the application

### Next Steps
- Create migration and update seed script with new roles
- Implement LocationUser creation for LocationAdmins
- Update data/reporting pages to filter by user's locations
- Test the implementation on the EC2 server
- Add documentation for the new features

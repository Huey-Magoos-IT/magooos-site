## New Client-Side CSV Processing Implementation

### Overview
We implemented a new client-side CSV processing system for the reporting page that provides an alternative to the existing Lambda-based report generation. This new approach directly accesses CSV files in our S3 data pool, processes them in the browser, and displays results immediately to users without server-side processing.

### Motivation
The previous Lambda-based approach had several limitations:
- API Gateway has a 29-second timeout limit, preventing processing of large datasets
- Each report generation required a full Lambda execution, increasing costs and processing time
- Users had to wait for report generation to complete before seeing any results
- The system was dependent on server-side infrastructure

### Implementation Details

#### 1. CSV Processing Library (`client/src/lib/csvProcessing.ts`)
We created a comprehensive utility library for handling CSV operations:

- **S3 File Management**
  - `fetchFiles`: Lists files available in the S3 bucket
  - `filterFilesByDateAndType`: Filters files by date range and report type
  - `extractDateFromFilename`: Parses dates from standardized filename format

- **CSV Data Processing**
  - `fetchCSV`: Retrieves CSV content from a URL
  - `parseCSV`: Converts CSV text to structured data using PapaParse
  - `processMultipleCSVs`: Combines data from multiple CSV files
  - `filterData`: Applies location and discount filters to data

- **Export Functionality**
  - `convertToCSV`: Converts processed data back to CSV format
  - `downloadCSV`: Enables client-side export of filtered data

#### 2. Data Display Component (`client/src/components/CSVDataTable/index.tsx`)
We created a new React component to handle the display of CSV data:
- Sortable columns
- Pagination support
- Responsive design
- Search/filter capabilities
- Export options

#### 3. Reporting Page Enhancements (`client/src/app/departments/reporting/page.tsx`)
- **UI Improvements**
  - Added toggle switch to choose between Lambda and client-side processing
  - Implemented report type selector specific to client-side processing
  - Added progress indicators for multi-stage processing

- **Dual Processing Approach**
  - Maintained backward compatibility with the Lambda approach
  - Added new `processCSVData` function for client-side processing
  - Created separation of concerns between the two approaches

### Benefits
1. **Improved Performance**: Client-side processing eliminates the Lambda execution time for smaller datasets
2. **Immediate Results**: Users see data immediately without waiting for background processing
3. **Bypasses Timeouts**: Avoids the 29-second API Gateway timeout limitation
4. **Reduced Costs**: Fewer Lambda executions and lower bandwidth usage
5. **Offline Capabilities**: Foundation for potential offline data processing in the future

### Technical Architecture
This implementation follows a hybrid approach:
- For small to medium reports: Client-side processing provides immediate results
- For large reports: Lambda processing still available for heavy-duty processing
- Shared filtering logic ensures consistent results between both approaches

## Reporting Page Location Filtering Fix

### Issue Description
We experienced issues when attempting to filter location data in the client-side processing mode of the reporting page. Specifically, when selecting a location like "Winter Garden, FL" (ID: 4046), the system would show "No data available" despite data being present for that location in the underlying CSV files.

### Root Cause Analysis
Through diagnostic logging and step-by-step debugging, we identified that the location filtering was actually working correctly, but the discount ID filtering was blocking all results:

1. The CSV data contains discount values formatted as percentage strings (e.g., "62.15%")
2. The filtering logic attempted to convert these strings to numbers with `Number("62.15%")`, which returns `NaN`
3. `NaN` doesn't match any discount IDs, so all records were being filtered out
4. Since both location AND discount filters needed to pass, no records were displayed at all

This issue was particularly confusing because:
- The raw data correctly included records for the selected location
- The location ID to name mapping was working properly
- But the combined filtering operation resulted in empty data sets

### Solution Implemented

We modified the discount ID filtering logic to use a more intuitive approach:

1. When default discount IDs are selected (the initial state), we now **skip discount ID filtering entirely**
2. This matches user expectations - selecting the default set should show all data without filtering
3. Only when custom discount IDs are explicitly selected do we apply strict discount ID filtering
4. We added comprehensive documentation explaining this special case handling

The solution preserves backward compatibility with existing report functionality while fixing the issue that prevented location filtering from working properly.

### Code Changes

#### 1. Modified `filterData` function in `client/src/lib/csvProcessing.ts`:
- Added detection for default discount IDs
- Implemented conditional skip of discount filtering for default IDs
- Added detailed documentation explaining the special case handling
- Removed unnecessary attempts to parse percentage strings

#### 2. Cleaned up `client/src/app/departments/reporting/page.tsx`:
- Refactored the `processCSVData` function 
- Removed diagnostic code after confirming the fix
- Maintained the pattern of passing location objects to the filter function

### Testing Verification
The fix was tested with the following scenario:
- Toggle to client-side processing mode
- Select Jan 14-15, 2025 as the date range
- Select Winter Garden, FL (4046) location
- Click "Process Data"

The system now correctly displays all 31 records for Winter Garden, FL within the selected date range.

### Future Recommendations
1. Consider adding unit tests for filtering logic with special focus on edge cases like percentage string handling
2. Implement a more robust data type conversion system for CSV data to handle various string formats
3. Evaluate whether the current approach to filtering (skipping for defaults) aligns with expected behavior in other parts of the application

## CSV Data Table Enhancements

### Overview
We've enhanced the CSV data table component with expandable view capability to improve data visualization and user experience when working with large datasets. Additionally, we've modified the date range selection to allow more flexibility for client-side processing.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Expand/Collapse Functionality
We've implemented a toggle system in the CSVDataTable component that allows users to view all rows at once:

- **Toggle Button**: Added a "Show All Rows"/"Collapse Table" button in the data table header
- **Dynamic Height**: Removed the fixed height constraint when expanded to show all rows without scrolling
- **Visual Indicator**: Added a clear indicator in the table footer when in expanded view
- **Smooth Transitions**: Incorporated CSS transitions for a polished user experience

This enhancement addresses the limitation of only seeing a few rows at a time in the previous fixed-height scrollable container.

#### 2. Extended Date Range for Client-Side Processing

We've enhanced the date picker functionality to allow more flexibility based on the processing mode:

- **Client-Side Processing**:
  - End date can now be selected up to the current day
  - Helper text updated to indicate "Range: Jan 14, 2025 - Today"
  - Supports more current data analysis without artificial date constraints

- **Lambda Processing**:
  - Maintained original date constraints (Jan 14 - Feb 28, 2025)
  - Preserves backward compatibility with the existing Lambda setup

### Code Changes

#### 1. Modified `client/src/components/CSVDataTable/index.tsx`:
- Added state variable `isExpanded` to track view mode
- Implemented toggle button with clear visual indicators
- Modified TableContainer to use dynamic maxHeight based on expanded state
- Added footer indicator showing when expanded view is active

#### 2. Updated `client/src/app/departments/reporting/page.tsx`:
- Modified DatePicker component to conditionally set maxDate based on processing mode
- Updated helper text to reflect the appropriate date range options
- Maintained separate logic for Lambda vs. client-side processing

### Benefits
1. **Improved Data Visibility**: Users can now see all report data without scrolling constraints
2. **More Current Data**: Access to data up to the current day for client-side processing
3. **Consistent Experience**: Maintains appropriate constraints for server-side processing
4. **Better User Control**: Gives users flexibility to choose their preferred view mode

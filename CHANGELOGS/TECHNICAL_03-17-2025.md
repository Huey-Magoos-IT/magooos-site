## Data Department Enhancement: Client-Side CSV Processing

### Overview
Enhanced the Data Department page with client-side CSV processing capabilities, replicating the functionality previously implemented for the Reporting Department. This update provides a consistent user experience across departments while enabling direct access to the "qu-location-ids" S3 bucket.

### Changes

#### New Features
- **Client-Side CSV Processing**: Implemented browser-based CSV processing for the Data Department
- **S3 Integration**: Configured direct access to the "qu-location-ids" S3 bucket
- **Data Filtering**: Added location and discount ID filtering with the same approach as Reporting
- **Data Visualization**: Integrated the CSVDataTable component for interactive data display
- **Date Range Selection**: Maintained consistent date range restrictions (Jan 13, 2025 to yesterday)

#### Technical Implementation
- Reused existing CSV processing utilities from the Reporting implementation
- Added placeholder data types that will be updated when actual CSV format is provided
- Maintained consistent UI patterns between departments for user experience
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states
- Preserved role-based access control (DATA role required)

#### Code Changes
- Updated `client/src/app/departments/data/page.tsx` with CSV processing capabilities
- Configured S3 bucket URL to "qu-location-ids.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com"
- Added placeholder data types with documentation for future updates
- Integrated LocationTable component for location selection
- Implemented discount ID filtering with special handling for defaults

### Benefits
- Consistent user experience across Data and Reporting departments
- Improved data analysis capabilities for the Data Department
- Direct access to S3 data without server-side processing
- Efficient reuse of existing components and utilities
- Flexible implementation that can be easily updated when CSV format is finalized

### Next Steps
- Update data types when actual CSV format is provided
- Implement specific sorting and filtering based on actual data structure
- Add data visualization features (charts, graphs) in future updates

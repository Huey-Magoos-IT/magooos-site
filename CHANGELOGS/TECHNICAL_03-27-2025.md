## CSV Data Enhancement: Employee Name Resolution

### Overview
Implemented a new feature to resolve "Unknown" guest names in CSV reports by fetching employee data from the "employee-list-incentivio" bucket. This enhancement improves data quality and usability in both the Reporting and Data Department pages.

### Update (March 27, 2025 - 11:30 AM)
Enhanced the employee name resolution implementation to more closely match the Python Lambda implementation, with additional debugging to identify why unknown names might still appear:

1. **Improved CSV Parsing**
   - Modified the CSV parsing to exactly match the Python implementation
   - Added manual line-by-line parsing for better control over the format
   - Enhanced logging to show header information and record counts

2. **Enhanced Debugging**
   - Added detailed logging for unknown employee IDs
   - Implemented statistics tracking for name resolution success rates
   - Added sample data logging to verify loyalty ID formats
   - Improved error reporting for troubleshooting

### Implementation Details

#### New Functionality
- Added employee data fetching from S3 bucket "employee-list-incentivio"
- Implemented mapping of loyalty IDs to employee names
- Enhanced CSV data with proper employee names instead of "Unknown" placeholders
- Added caching mechanism to avoid redundant employee data fetching

#### Technical Components
1. **Employee Data Fetching**
   - Created `fetchEmployeeData()` function to retrieve and parse employee data from S3
   - Implemented caching to improve performance for subsequent requests
   - Added error handling with graceful fallbacks
   - Added support for various CSV column formats to handle different export formats

2. **Name Resolution Logic**
   - Implemented `getEmployeeName()` function to map loyalty IDs to employee names
   - Added fallback format "Unknown (ID: xyz)" to preserve original IDs when no match is found
   - Ensured compatibility with various loyalty ID field naming conventions
   - Added ID normalization to handle different formatting of the same ID

3. **CSV Data Enhancement**
   - Created `enhanceCSVWithEmployeeNames()` function to process CSV data
   - Added support for various loyalty ID field names in CSV data
   - Preserved original loyalty IDs while adding enhanced name information

4. **Integration with Existing Workflow**
   - Updated both Reporting and Data Department pages to use the new enhancement
   - Added progress indicators for employee data fetching and processing
   - Maintained compatibility with existing filtering and location name enhancement

### Benefits
- Improved data quality with actual employee names instead of "Unknown" placeholders
- Enhanced reporting readability and usability
- Maintained original loyalty IDs for reference and troubleshooting
- Implemented efficient caching to minimize performance impact

### Technical Notes
- The employee data is fetched from "Customer_Export.csv" in the "employee-list-incentivio" bucket
- Expected CSV format includes columns: "Loyalty ID", "First Name", "Last Name"
- The enhancement preserves all existing functionality while adding the name resolution feature
- Caching mechanism prevents redundant fetching of employee data during the same session

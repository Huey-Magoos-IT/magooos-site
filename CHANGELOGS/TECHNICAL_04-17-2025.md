# Technical Changelog: April 17, 2025

## Location Selection Functionality Enhancement

### Overview
Enhanced the location selection functionality across the data page, reporting page, and group creation to improve user experience and provide more intuitive controls.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Required Location Selection
- Modified the submit button to be disabled until at least one location is selected
- Updated the placeholder text to indicate that location selection is required
- Implemented this change consistently across data, reporting, and groups pages

#### 2. Added "Add All" Button
- Added an "Add All" button next to the "Clear All" button for quick selection of all available locations
- Implemented proper filtering to respect user permissions when adding all locations
- Maintained consistent styling and placement across all pages

#### 3. Implemented True Undo Functionality
- Added state tracking to remember the previous state of selected locations
- Implemented action type tracking to identify the last action performed
- Created dedicated handler functions for each action type (add, remove, clear all, add all)
- Implemented a proper undo function that restores the previous state based on the last action
- Disabled the undo button when no action has been performed

### Technical Implementation Details

#### State Management
- Added `previousLocations` state to store the previous selection state
- Added `lastAction` state to track the type of the last action performed
- Created handler functions for each action type that save the current state before making changes

#### Button Logic
- The submit button is now disabled when `selectedLocations.length === 0`
- The undo button is disabled when `!lastAction`
- The clear all button is disabled when `selectedLocations.length === 0`

#### Files Modified
- `client/src/app/departments/data/page.tsx`
- `client/src/app/departments/reporting/page.tsx`
- `client/src/app/groups/page.tsx`

### Benefits
- More intentional user interaction with explicit location selection required
- Improved user experience with balanced options for both selecting all and clearing all locations
- More intuitive and powerful undo capability that follows standard application patterns
- Consistent behavior across all location selection interfaces

### Next Steps
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+Z for undo, etc.)
- Explore the possibility of adding a history-based undo with multiple steps
- Gather user feedback on the enhanced location selection functionality

## Investigation History

### Team Assignment Permission Model (March 7, 2025)
1. **Problem identified**: Users removed from teams couldn't be added back (403 errors)
2. **Root cause analysis**: Controller checking target user's admin status instead of requesting user's
3. **Solution implemented**: Simplified permission model focusing on authenticated user
4. **Verification**: Successfully tested adding/removing users from all teams

### API Gateway Route Patterns (March 6, 2025)
1. **Problem identified**: Certain API routes not working through API Gateway
2. **Root cause analysis**: API Gateway proxy integration has path mapping limitations
3. **Solution implemented**: Multiple equivalent endpoints with different path structures
4. **Verification**: All team and role operations working through API Gateway

### Role-Based Department Access (March 5, 2025)
1. **Problem identified**: Department access control inconsistent
2. **Root cause analysis**: No proper role checking in sidebar and department routes
3. **Solution implemented**: Role-based checks in sidebar and route guards
4. **Verification**: Users can only access departments based on their team's roles

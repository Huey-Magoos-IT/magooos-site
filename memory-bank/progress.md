# Progress Tracking

## Current Implementation: Groups Functionality

### Status: Implementation Phase

#### Completed
- ‚úÖ Backend and frontend for Groups are now architecturally identical to Teams (except for data stored)
- ‚úÖ All permission checks, controller logic, and routes are consistent with Teams
- ‚úÖ Prisma client is up-to-date and recognizes the Group model
- ‚úÖ All endpoints for Groups (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, assign, etc.) match the Teams pattern
- ‚úÖ Created GroupCard component for UI
- ‚úÖ Created Groups management page
- ‚úÖ Updated API slice with new endpoints
- ‚úÖ Added access control utilities for location-based permissions

#### In Progress
- üîÑ GET /groups returns 401 Unauthorized due to API Gateway authorizer, not backend code
- üîÑ Debugging API Gateway authorizer and frontend request headers

#### Pending
- ‚è≥ Make /groups GET public in API Gateway (or ensure frontend sends JWT)
- ‚è≥ Implement LocationUser creation flow
- ‚è≥ Update data/reporting pages with location filtering
- ‚è≥ Test the implementation on the EC2 server
- ‚è≥ Add documentation for the new features

### Next Steps
1. Check API Gateway: Is authorizer attached to /groups GET but not /teams or /users?
2. Check proxy+ mapping: Is /groups included?
3. Check frontend: Is Authorization header sent for /groups?
4. Make /groups GET public in API Gateway if needed.
5. Create migration and update seed script with new roles (if not already done)
6. Implement LocationUser creation for LocationAdmins
7. Update data/reporting pages to filter by user's locations
8. Test the implementation on the EC2 server
9. Add documentation for the new features

### Implementation Details

#### Database Schema
```prisma
// Add to schema.prisma
model Group {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String
  description String?
  locationIds String[]  // Array of location IDs
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  users       User[]    // LocationAdmin users assigned to this group
}

// Update User model
model User {
  // Existing fields...
  groupId      Int?       // For LocationAdmin users
  group        Group?     @relation(fields: [groupId], references: [id])
  locationIds  String[]   // Array of location IDs the user has access to
}
```

7. Update data/reporting pages to filter by user's locations

### Authentication Fix Details
We identified and fixed an authentication issue in the Group controller:

1. **Problem**: The `/groups` endpoint was returning 401 Unauthorized errors
2. **Root Cause**:
   - The frontend was sending authentication via the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token
   - The backend was only checking for `x-user-cognito-id` header or `requestingUserId` in the body
3. **Solution**:
   - Added code to all group controller methods to also check for and use the Bearer token
   - Implemented a simple JWT token extraction and admin user lookup
4. **Verification**:
   - Deployed the fix to the EC2 server
   - Confirmed the `/groups` endpoint now returns 200 OK with proper data
   - Logs show the Bearer token is being properly recognized and processed

### Implementation Details

#### Database Schema
```prisma
// Add to schema.prisma
model Group {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String
  description String?
  locationIds String[]  // Array of location IDs
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  users       User[]    // LocationAdmin users assigned to this group
}

// Update User model
model User {
  // Existing fields...
  groupId      Int?       // For LocationAdmin users
  group        Group?     @relation(fields: [groupId], references: [id])
  locationIds  String[]   // Array of location IDs the user has access to
}

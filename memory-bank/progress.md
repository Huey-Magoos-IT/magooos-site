# Progress Tracking

## Current Implementation: UI/UX Improvements & Bug Fixes (April 22, 2025)

### Status: Implementation Phase

#### Completed (April 22, 2025)
- ✅ Cleaned up sidebar navigation (hid Home, Settings, Search).
- ✅ Restricted Users link visibility to Admins/Location Admins.
- ✅ Implemented role-based access control and filtering on the Users page.
- ✅ Implemented user-membership filtering on the Teams page.
- ✅ Changed default application route to `/teams`.
- ✅ Implemented modal-based location editing in `UserCard`.
- ✅ Fixed client-side API definition and call for `updateUserLocations` (added `requestingUserId`).
- ✅ Fixed server-side authentication logic in `updateUserLocations` controller (using robust auth checks).
- ✅ Added username sorting to the `getUsers` backend endpoint.

### Location Update Authentication Fix Details (April 22, 2025)

- **Problem**: `PATCH /users/:id/locations` failed with 500 error.
- **Root Cause**: Server controller (`updateUserLocations`) didn't correctly identify the requesting user (missing `requestingUserId` or other auth methods).
- **Solution**:
    - Updated client API definition (`client/src/state/api.ts`) for `updateUserLocations` to include `requestingUserId`.
    - Updated `UserCard` component (`client/src/components/UserCard/index.tsx`) to send `requestingUserId` in the mutation body.
    - Refactored `updateUserLocations` in `server/src/controllers/userController.ts` to use robust authentication logic (checking body, headers).
- **Result**: Location updates now authenticate correctly and succeed.

## Current Implementation: Groups Functionality

### Status: Implementation Phase

#### Completed
- ✅ Backend and frontend for Groups are now architecturally identical to Teams (except for data stored)
- ✅ All permission checks, controller logic, and routes are consistent with Teams
- ✅ Prisma client is up-to-date and recognizes the Group model
- ✅ All endpoints for Groups (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, assign, etc.) match the Teams pattern
- ✅ Created GroupCard component for UI
- ✅ Created Groups management page
- ✅ Updated API slice with new endpoints
- ✅ Added access control utilities for location-based permissions
- ✅ Fixed authentication issue in Group controller by adding Bearer token support
- ✅ Successfully tested authentication fix on the EC2 server
- ✅ Enhanced GroupCard component with improved styling and user management
- ✅ Added user removal functionality to groups
- ✅ Added Groups link to the sidebar for admins and location admins
- ✅ Fixed build issues with proper imports in the server code
- ✅ Enhanced location selection functionality across data, reporting, and groups pages

#### In Progress
- ✅ Enhancing Groups UI with improved styling and user management
- ✅ Adding user removal functionality
- ✅ Improving location selection functionality

#### Pending
- ⏳ Implement LocationUser creation flow
- ⏳ Update data/reporting pages with location filtering

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Enhanced the GroupCard UI with better styling and user management
2. ✅ Implemented user removal functionality for groups
3. ✅ Added Groups to the sidebar navigation for easier access
4. ✅ Enhanced location selection with required selection, Add All button, and proper undo functionality
5. Create migration and update seed script with new roles (if not already done)
6. Implement LocationUser creation for LocationAdmins
7. Update data/reporting pages to filter by user's locations

### Authentication Fix Details
We identified and fixed an authentication issue in the Group controller:

1. **Problem**: The `/groups` endpoint was returning 401 Unauthorized errors
2. **Root Cause**:
   - The frontend was sending authentication via the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token
   - The backend was only checking for `x-user-cognito-id` header or `requestingUserId` in the body
3. **Solution**:
   - Added code to all group controller methods to also check for and use the Bearer token
   - Implemented a simple JWT token extraction and admin user lookup
4. **Verification**:
   - Deployed the fix to the EC2 server
   - Confirmed the `/groups` endpoint now returns 200 OK with proper data
   - Logs show the Bearer token is being properly recognized and processed

### Implementation Details

#### Database Schema
```prisma
// Add to schema.prisma
model Group {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String
  description String?
  locationIds String[]  // Array of location IDs
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  users       User[]    // LocationAdmin users assigned to this group
}

// Update User model
model User {
  // Existing fields...
  groupId      Int?       // For LocationAdmin users
  group        Group?     @relation(fields: [groupId], references: [id])
  locationIds  String[]   // Array of location IDs the user has access to
}

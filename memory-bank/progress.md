# Project Progress

## API Integration Issues - 2025-03-07

### Completed Tasks



#### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated systemPatterns.md with API Gateway constraints
- ✅ Added Simplicity-First Development Pattern to systemPatterns.md
- ✅ Added Debugging and Troubleshooting Pattern to systemPatterns.md
- ✅ Updated decisionLog.md with Team Assignment API fix decisions
- ✅ Updated activeContext.md with current focus and next steps

### In Progress
- 🔄 Review other API endpoints for similar routing issues
- 🔄 Consider refactoring similar custom endpoints to use existing routes
- 🔄 Improve error handling for edge cases across the application

### Pending Tasks
- ⏳ Establish consistent pattern for all API endpoint designs
- ⏳ Create API endpoint testing script to validate routes through API Gateway
- ⏳ Review and consolidate error handling approaches
- ⏳ Consider adding correlation IDs to track requests across services
- ⏳ Document API Gateway configuration constraints for future development

### Insights and Patterns
1. **Route Constraints**
   - API Gateway only handles certain route patterns reliably
   - Base on routes on `/teams/*` and `/projects/*` patterns
   - Avoid custom routes that might not be properly configured

2. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Special cases need dedicated endpoints (e.g., "no team" option)
   - Null/special values require explicit handling
   - Edge conditions should be tested separately from main flows

3. **Implementation Approach**
   - Use standard library patterns over custom implementations
   - Keep conditional logic simple and explicit
   - Leverage existing endpoints with different parameters
   - Separate special case handling with dedicated endpoints

### Next Key Tasks
1. Review users API for similar routing issues
2. Examine project assignment functionality for edge cases
3. Consider creating a testing utility for API Gateway routing
4. Document patterns and constraints for future development

# Feature Implementation Plan

## 1. Team Assignment Security Improvements

### Current System
Currently, users can join any team through self-service, which creates a security risk:
- Users can join teams they shouldn't have access to
- No approval process for team membership
- Potential for unauthorized access to department-specific features

### Proposed Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Admin User] -->|Manages Teams| B[User Management Interface]
    B -->|Assigns user to team| C[Team Assignment API]
    C -->|Update| D[User-Team Relationship]
    E[Regular User] -.-x|Cannot Self-Join| F[Teams Page]
    F -->|View Only| G[Available Teams]
    H[User Profile] -->|Displays| D
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Backend Modifications**
   - Modify the existing `/teams/:teamId/join` endpoint to restrict access to admin users only
   - Add admin role verification middleware to the join endpoint
   - Create additional endpoint variants for API Gateway compatibility (following our established pattern)
   - Add detailed logging for troubleshooting API Gateway mapping issues

2. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - Add team assignment interface to the Users page for admins
   - Display current team assignment in user profiles
   - Implement team selection dropdown with available teams
   - Remove join functionality from Teams page for non-admin users
   - Convert Teams page to view-only display for regular users
   - Maintain team creation capability for admin users only

3. **State Management Updates**
   - Update API client to reflect the admin-only team assignment logic
   - Implement proper cache invalidation for user and team data
   - Ensure state consistency across the application

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Verify admin role before allowing team assignment
   - Log all team assignment actions for audit purposes
   - Implement proper validation to prevent unauthorized team assignments
   - Ensure consistent permission checks across all team management functionality

## 2. Data Department Page Enhancement

### Architecture Overview

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Department Page] --> B[Filtering UI]
    B --> |Location Filter| C[LocationTable Component]
    B --> |Date Range Filter| D[DatePicker Component]
    C --> E[S3 Data Integration]
    D --> E
    E --> |Filtered Data| F[Data Table Display]
    F --> |Export| G[CSV Download Function]
    A --> |Role Check| H[hasRole with DATA permission]
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **S3 Integration Approach**
   - Configure API Gateway for S3 bucket access without AWS SDK
   - Create endpoints for listing and retrieving files from the S3 bucket
   - Implement mapping templates for S3 operations
   - Set up proper authentication and authorization for S3 access
   - Integrate with frontend through the Lambda API gateway

2. **CSV Processing System**
   - Design client-side CSV processing workflow
   - Implement filtering functionality by location and date range
   - Create data transformation utilities for different data formats
   - Optimize for performance with large CSV files
   - Support various CSV formats and layouts

3. **Filtering Interface**
   - Design a user-friendly filtering UI with:
     - Location selector with available locations
     - Date range picker for temporal filtering
     - Apply filters button to trigger data refresh
     - Reset button to clear all filters
   - Ensure the filtering interface is responsive and accessible
   - Implement validation for filter inputs
   - Save filter preferences for user sessions

4. **Data Table Component**
   - Create a flexible data table for displaying filtered CSV data
   - Implement sortable columns for better data exploration
   - Add pagination for large datasets
   - Include data visualization options where appropriate
   - Provide a download button to export filtered data as CSV
   - Support customizable column visibility
   - Optimize rendering for performance with large datasets

5. **Permission Control**
   - Restrict access to DATA role members only
   - Implement role verification at both frontend and backend
   - Handle unauthorized access gracefully with informative messages
   - Track data access patterns for security audit purposes

## 3. Red Flag Report Enhancement

### Integration with Filtering System

The goal is to create a consistent filtering experience across the Data Department and Red Flag Report pages.

1. **Component Reusability**
   - Design reusable filtering components that can be shared between pages
   - Maintain consistent UI patterns and interaction models
   - Share utilities for date/location filtering
   - Ensure consistent styling and behavior

2. **Implementation Approach**
   - Extract filtering logic into reusable components
   - Apply these components to both Data and Red Flag pages
   - Ensure that filters work seamlessly with both data sources
   - Implement specialized filtering options for Red Flag reports as needed
   - Maintain consistent visual language and interaction patterns

3. **Data Integration**
   - Connect the filtering system to the appropriate data sources
   - Ensure filtering logic works correctly for both report types
   - Optimize query performance for filtered results
   - Implement appropriate caching strategies
   - Provide clear loading states during data retrieval

4. **User Experience**
   - Design a consistent and intuitive user interface for filtering
   - Provide clear visual feedback for active filters
   - Include the ability to save and load filter presets
   - Ensure accessibility across all filtering components
   - Support responsive layouts for all screen sizes

## 4. Final UI Refinement

### Huey Aesthetics
- Apply consistent branding throughout the application
- Update color scheme to match Huey guidelines
- Improve visual hierarchy for better usability
- Implement consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure all UI elements follow the design system

### Hide Non-Essentials
- Implement role-based UI rendering to show only relevant features
- Create feature flags for controlling in-development features
- Simplify navigation based on user roles
- Remove or hide legacy features that are no longer needed
- Focus the UI on core workflows for each user type

### Implementation Strategy
1. Create shared styling constants for consistent branding

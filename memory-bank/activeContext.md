## Current Task: UI/UX Improvements & Bug Fixes (April 22, 2025)

We implemented several UI/UX improvements and fixed a critical bug related to user location management.

**Key Changes:**
1.  **Sidebar Cleanup**: Hid non-essential links (Home, Settings, Search).
2.  **Users Page Access**: Restricted access to Admins/Location Admins and implemented filtering for Location Admins.
3.  **Teams Page Filtering**: Show only teams the user is part of (admins see all).
4.  **Default Route**: Changed default route to `/teams`.
5.  **Location Management Fix**: Implemented a modal for editing user locations in `UserCard` and fixed the server-side authentication bug (`updateUserLocations` controller) causing 500 errors.
6.  **User Sorting**: Ensured users are consistently sorted by username in the Users list.

## Current Status

- ✅ Cleaned up sidebar navigation.
- ✅ Implemented role-based access control and filtering on the Users page.
- ✅ Implemented user-membership filtering on the Teams page.
- ✅ Changed default application route to `/teams`.
- ✅ Implemented modal-based location editing in `UserCard`.
- ✅ Fixed client-side API definition and call for `updateUserLocations`.
- ✅ Fixed server-side authentication logic in `updateUserLocations` controller.
- ✅ Added username sorting to the `getUsers` backend endpoint.

## Location Update Authentication Fix Details (April 22, 2025)

- **Problem**: `PATCH /users/:id/locations` failed with 500 error.
- **Root Cause**: Server controller (`updateUserLocations`) didn't correctly identify the requesting user (missing `requestingUserId` or other auth methods).
- **Solution**:
    - Updated client API definition (`client/src/state/api.ts`) for `updateUserLocations` to include `requestingUserId`.
    - Updated `UserCard` component (`client/src/components/UserCard/index.tsx`) to send `requestingUserId` in the mutation body.
    - Refactored `updateUserLocations` in `server/src/controllers/userController.ts` to use robust authentication logic (checking body, headers).
- **Result**: Location updates now authenticate correctly and succeed.

## Next Steps

- ⬜ Implement LocationUser creation for LocationAdmins (if still required).
- ⬜ Update data/reporting pages to filter by user's locations (if still required).
- ⬜ Further testing on EC2 server.

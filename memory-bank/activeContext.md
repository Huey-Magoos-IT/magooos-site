# Active Context - Users Page Redesign

We're working on enhancing the Users page with the following priorities:

1. **Dual View Options (Grid/List)**
   - Implement a toggle between grid and card-based views
   - Grid view: Enhanced version of the current DataGrid

2. **Role Visualization**
   - Display user roles and permissions directly in the UI
   - Use color-coded badges to indicate different role types
   - Add tooltips with detailed role descriptions
   - Allow direct role management for admin users

3. **Team Selection Improvements**
   - Fix the team dropdown cutoff issue
   - Enhance the team selection interface
   - Show team roles directly in the user interface

4. **Layout Restructuring**
   - Better utilize available screen space
   - Create a more comprehensive layout
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

- ✅ Created comprehensive enhancement plan
- ✅ Prioritized dual view options and role visualization
- ✅ Implemented view toggle component
- ✅ Enhanced grid view with role information
- ✅ Created list view with user cards
- ✅ Implemented role badge component
- ✅ Fixed team dropdown cutoff issue

- ✅ Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes

## Recent UI and Build Improvements (March 31, 2025 - Afternoon)

### Search and Filtering Implementation
1. Added comprehensive search functionality
   - Implemented search bar for filtering users by username
   - Added team filter dropdown for filtering by team
   - Created client-side filtering logic with useMemo
   - Added "No results found" message with clear filters button
   - Ensured filtering works for both grid and card views

### UI Enhancements
1. Fixed team dropdown clipping issues
   - Removed labels from all team selector dropdowns in the DataGrid
   - Removed labels from the team filter dropdown in the search bar
   - Removed labels from the team selector in the UserCard component
   - Maintained section headers for context

2. Fixed ViewToggle component icons
   - Used List icon (horizontal lines) for table view (grid viewType)
   - Used Grid icon (squares) for card view (list viewType)
   - Updated tooltips to "Table View" and "Card View" for clarity
   - Ensured icons match the actual view being displayed

### Build Fixes
1. Type error in search/page.tsx:
   - The UserCard component in search/page.tsx was passing a User object directly to the UserCard component
   - The UserCard component expects specific props including teams, isAdmin, onTeamChange, and updateStatus
   - Fixed by properly mapping the User object to the expected props structure

2. React Hooks warnings in users/page.tsx:
   - Fixed conditional React Hook call by moving useMemo before any conditional returns
   - Wrapped the handleTeamChange function in useCallback with proper dependencies
   - Wrapped the handleTeamChangeEvent function in useCallback with proper dependencies
   - Used useMemo for teams and availableRoles to prevent them from being recalculated on every render
   - These changes ensure proper dependency tracking in the useMemo hook for columns

These improvements enhance the user experience with better filtering capabilities and a more intuitive interface, while also resolving all build errors and warnings shown in the deployment logs, allowing the application to be successfully built and deployed.

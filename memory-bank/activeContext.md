# Active Context

## Current Task: Implementing Groups Functionality

We are implementing a new Groups functionality for Magoo's Site that will allow for location-based access control. This feature will enable:

1. Admins to create groups of locations
2. Admins to assign LocationAdmin users to manage these groups
3. LocationAdmins to create LocationUsers with access to specific locations within their group
4. Location-based filtering of data in reporting and data pages

## Implementation Approach

We've chosen a balanced approach that:
- Uses array fields for storing location IDs in both Group and User models
- Maintains proper relationships between entities
- Reuses existing components like LocationTable
- Enforces proper permission boundaries

## Key Components

1. **Database Schema**:
   - New Group model with locationIds array
   - Updated User model with groupId and locationIds fields
   - New roles: LOCATION_ADMIN and LOCATION_USER

2. **Backend**:
   - Group controller for CRUD operations
   - User controller extensions for location management
   - Permission checks and validation

3. **Frontend**:
   - Groups management page
   - Location selection interface
   - User creation flow for LocationAdmins

## Current Status

- ✅ Updated Prisma schema with Group model and User model changes
- ✅ Implemented Group controller and routes (now architecturally identical to Teams)
- ✅ Updated User controller with location management functions
- ✅ Created GroupCard component for UI
- ✅ Created Groups management page
- ✅ Updated API slice with new endpoints
- ✅ Added access control utilities for location-based permissions
- ✅ Fixed authentication issue in Group controller by adding Bearer token support
- ✅ Enhanced GroupCard component with improved styling and user management
- ✅ Added user removal functionality to groups
- ✅ Added Groups link to the sidebar for admins and location admins

## Authentication Fix Details

We identified and fixed an authentication issue in the Group controller:

1. The frontend was sending authentication via the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token
2. The backend was only checking for `x-user-cognito-id` header or `requestingUserId` in the body
3. We added code to all group controller methods to also check for and use the Bearer token
4. The fix was successful, and the `/groups` endpoint now properly authenticates requests

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fixed API Gateway authentication issue by adding Bearer token support in the controller
2. ✅ Enhanced the GroupCard UI with better styling and user management
3. ✅ Implemented user removal functionality for groups
4. ✅ Added Groups to the sidebar navigation for easier access
5. ✅ Enhanced location selection with required selection, Add All button, and proper undo functionality
6. ⬜ Implement LocationUser creation for LocationAdmins
7. ⬜ Update data/reporting pages to filter by user's locations
8. ⬜ Test the implementation on the EC2 server

## Current Focus: Location Selection Enhancement

We have enhanced the location selection functionality across the application:
1. Made the submit button unavailable until at least one location is chosen
2. Added an "Add All" button next to the "Clear All" button for quick selection
3. Implemented proper undo functionality that tracks the last action and can revert it
4. Maintained consistent behavior across data, reporting, and groups pages

These enhancements improve the user experience for location selection:
- Users must now explicitly select at least one location before submitting
- The "Add All" button provides a quick way to select all available locations
- The undo functionality allows users to revert any action (add, remove, clear all, add all)
- Consistent behavior across all pages provides a unified user experience

Previous Focus: User Management in Groups
- Improved GroupCard component with larger, more visually appealing design
- Added user removal functionality to allow admins to remove users from groups
- Added Groups link to the sidebar for both admins and location admins
- Fixed build issues with proper imports in the server code

## Technical Considerations

- The LocationTable component is already available and can be reused
- We need to adapt the state management to work with the Group creation/editing flow
- The UI should maintain consistency with the reporting page for better user experience
- We should preserve all existing functionality while enhancing the interface
- Location selection now requires at least one location to be selected before submission
- Proper undo functionality tracks the last action and previous state for better user experience

## Authentication System

### Implementation
The application uses AWS Cognito for user authentication with the following flow:
1. User registers or signs in through the Amplify UI components
2. Upon successful authentication, Cognito issues JWT tokens
3. Post-confirmation Lambda trigger creates user in database
4. Frontend stores tokens and includes them in API requests
5. API Gateway validates tokens before allowing access

### Components
- **Cognito User Pool**: Handles user registration, authentication, and token issuance
- **Lambda Trigger**: Creates user records in the application database
- **AuthProvider.tsx**: Cognito integration in the frontend
- **Token Injection**: Automatic JWT injection in API requests

### Features
- MFA support for admin users
- Email verification for new accounts
- Password policies with security requirements
- Token refresh logic for session maintenance

## Architecture & Development Principles

### API Gateway Integration Patterns
1. **Route Pattern Constraints**
   - Use established route patterns: `/teams/*` and `/projects/*`
   - Avoid custom route patterns that aren't configured in API Gateway
   - Follow consistent URL structure across all endpoints

2. **API Design Guidelines**
   - Use POST for most operations (even updates) for API Gateway compatibility
   - Create dedicated endpoints for edge cases (e.g., "no team" option)
   - Handle special values (null, 0, undefined) with specific endpoints
   - Maintain consistent response formats across all endpoints

3. **Client-Side Processing Pattern**
   - Implement dual processing approaches where appropriate (client-side and server-side)
   - Allow users to choose between processing methods based on dataset size
   - Access S3 data directly from the browser when possible
   - Process data incrementally to maintain UI responsiveness
   - Handle special cases in filter logic to match user expectations
   - Skip restrictive filtering for default values (show all data)
   - Provide clear progress indicators for multi-stage processing

4. **Simplicity First**
   - Use standard RTK Query patterns over custom implementations
   - Keep conditional logic simple and explicit
   - Prefer tried and tested library features over custom overrides
   - Implement minimal viable solutions first, then add complexity if needed

5. **Debugging Best Practices**
   - Add comprehensive logging at every stage of request processing
   - Include context details in all error messages
   - Test edge cases explicitly before deploying
   - Document known limitations and workarounds
   - Consider correlation IDs for cross-service request tracking

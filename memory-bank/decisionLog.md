# Architectural Decision Log

## Role-Based Access Control Implementation
- **Date**: Prior to March 2025
- **Decision**: Implement a granular role-based access control system with specific roles (ADMIN, DATA, REPORTING).
- **Context**: Need for department-specific access control and team-based permissions.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Simple admin/non-admin dichotomy
  - Permission-based system instead of role-based
  - User-level permissions instead of team-level
- **Decision Rationale**: Team-based role system provides better scalability and management while allowing for department-specific access.
- **Consequences**: 
  - Increased complexity in permission checks
  - Need for role management UI
  - More flexible access control system

## AWS SDK Prohibition
- **Date**: Project inception
- **Decision**: Strictly prohibit AWS SDK usage in codebase; use direct HTTP/HTTPS requests only.
- **Context**: Need for AWS service integration while maintaining flexibility and avoiding SDK lock-in.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Limited AWS SDK usage
  - Third-party AWS libraries
  - Custom SDK wrapper
- **Decision Rationale**: Direct HTTP requests provide more control, reduce dependencies, and avoid SDK versioning issues.
- **Consequences**:
  - More complex integration code
  - Need for detailed AWS API knowledge
  - More error-prone without SDK validations

## API Gateway Direct Integration
- **Date**: Prior to March 2025
- **Decision**: Use API Gateway direct integration for DynamoDB location data.
- **Context**: Need for efficient, serverless access to location data without Lambda overhead.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Lambda functions as intermediaries
  - EC2-based API for all data access
  - Client-side DynamoDB queries
- **Decision Rationale**: Direct integration provides fastest path to data with minimal infrastructure.
- **Consequences**:
  - Less flexibility for complex transformations
  - Mapping templates required in API Gateway
  - Reduced processing capabilities compared to Lambda

## Team Role Management Architecture
- **Date**: March 2025
- **Decision**: Implement team-level role assignments with auto-assignment based on team properties.
- **Context**: Need for simplified role management while maintaining granular access control.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - User-level role assignments
  - Fixed team types with predefined roles
  - Role inheritance hierarchy
- **Decision Rationale**: Team-level roles with auto-assignment simplifies management while providing necessary flexibility.
- **Consequences**:
  - Role checks must consider team membership
  - UI must display team roles clearly
  - Auto-assignment logic needs maintenance

## Multiple View Components for Projects
- **Date**: Prior to March 2025
- **Decision**: Implement multiple view components (Board, List, Table, Timeline) for project management.
- **Context**: Different users have different preferences for visualizing project data.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Single canonical view
  - Configurable single view
  - Third-party visualization libraries
- **Decision Rationale**: Multiple specialized views provide better user experience for different use cases.
- **Consequences**:
  - More components to maintain
  - Need for consistent data handling across views
  - Increased frontend complexity

## Department-Based Structure
- **Date**: Prior to March 2025
- **Decision**: Organize application sections by department with role-based restrictions.
- **Context**: Organization has department-specific workflows and access requirements.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Feature-based organization
  - User-specific customization
  - Single interface with conditional elements
- **Decision Rationale**: Department-based structure aligns with organizational structure and simplifies access control.
- **Consequences**:
  - Need for department-specific roles
  - Potential duplication of similar features
  - Clearer organizational alignment

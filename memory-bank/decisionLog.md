# Decision Log

## 2025-04-17: Location Selection Functionality Enhancement

### Problem
The location selection functionality across the application had several issues that needed to be addressed:
1. The submit button was enabled even when no locations were selected, automatically running for all available locations
2. There was a "Clear All" button for locations but no "Add All" button
3. The undo functionality needed to properly track and revert the last action performed

### Investigation
1. Examined the location selection implementation in data, reporting, and groups pages
2. Analyzed the LocationTable component to understand how it interacts with the parent components
3. Reviewed the current behavior of the submit button and location selection
4. Identified the need for proper state tracking to implement true undo functionality

- **Consequences**: Implementation can proceed with placeholders that can be easily updated later

#### Decision 4: Maintain Date Range Restrictions
- **Choice**: Keep the same date range restrictions (Jan 13, 2025 to yesterday)
- **Rationale**: Maintain consistency with the Reporting page and ensure data completeness
- **Consequences**: Consistent date handling across both department pages

### Implementation
1. Replicated the Reporting page structure for the Data Department
2. Updated S3 bucket reference to "qu-location-ids"
3. Added placeholder data types with clear documentation
4. Maintained the same date range restrictions
5. Reused existing CSV processing utilities and components
6. Updated Memory Bank documentation with implementation details

### Impact
- Enhanced Data Department with advanced CSV processing capabilities
- Maintained consistent user experience across departments
- Established a pattern for future data processing features
- Improved data analysis capabilities for the Data Department

## 2025-03-12: Reporting Date Range Update

### Problem
The reporting functionality needed an update to:
1. Expand the reporting pool to include January 13th, 2025 (previously started from January 14th)
2. Restrict the end date selection to yesterday's date instead of allowing current day selection

### Investigation
1. Reviewed current date restrictions in the reporting page
2. Identified code locations for both start and end date restrictions
3. Determined that the change affects both client-side and Lambda processing modes

### Decision Points

#### Decision 1: Expand Start Date to January 13th
- **Choice**: Change the minDate for start date from January 14th to January 13th, 2025
- **Rationale**: Allow access to additional historical data from January 13th
- **Consequences**: Increased data availability for reporting

#### Decision 2: Restrict End Date to Yesterday
- **Choice**: Calculate yesterday's date dynamically rather than allowing current day selection
- **Rationale**: Ensures reports only include complete days of data (current day is still in progress)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Using a fixed cutoff time on current day (rejected for simplicity and consistency)
  - Keeping the original behavior (rejected to ensure data completeness)
- **Consequences**: More consistent reporting with complete daily data

#### Decision 3: Allow Empty Date Fields Initially
- **Choice**: Remove automatic date initialization, allowing date fields to be empty by default
- **Rationale**: Provides users full control over date selection rather than pre-selecting dates
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Pre-populating with default dates (rejected based on user preference)
  - Setting only start date automatically (rejected for consistency)
- **Consequences**: Users must explicitly select dates before generating reports

#### Decision 4: Expand Date Navigation Beyond February
- **Choice**: Update date range to allow navigation to March and beyond (up to yesterday)
- **Rationale**: Removes artificial restriction that prevented calendar navigation to March
- **Consequences**: More flexible date selection while still maintaining the "yesterday" limit

### Implementation
1. Updated the DatePicker minDate for start date from January 14th to January 13th, 2025
2. Modified both date pickers to use dynamically calculated yesterday's date as the maxDate
3. Removed automatic date initialization in the useEffect hook, allowing fields to remain empty
4. Removed helper text from date pickers for a cleaner interface
5. Fixed calendar navigation to allow viewing months beyond February

### Impact
- Expanded data access to include January 13th, 2025
- Improved data consistency by excluding current day data
- Enhanced user experience with sensible default date values
- Maintained consistent behavior across both processing modes

## 2025-03-11: Client-Side CSV Processing Implementation

### Problem
The existing Lambda-based report generation system had several limitations:
1. API Gateway's 29-second timeout prevented processing of large datasets
2. Users had to wait for the entire report to process before seeing any results
3. Each report generation required a full Lambda execution, increasing costs
4. Error handling was limited by the Lambda execution environment

### Investigation
1. Analyzed existing report processing flow in Lambda
2. Reviewed S3 data storage structure and file format conventions
3. Evaluated client-side processing capabilities in modern browsers
4. Tested PapaParse library for CSV parsing performance

### Root Causes
1. **Architecture Limitation**: Lambda functions have execution time limits
2. **User Experience Issue**: Full report processing before display causes delays
3. **Cost Concern**: Each report generation requires Lambda resources
4. **Flexibility Limitation**: Server-side processing limits filter customization

### Decision Points

#### Decision 1: Implement Dual Processing Approach
- **Choice**: Create a client-side processing system while maintaining Lambda capability
- **Rationale**: Provides flexibility based on report size and complexity
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Migrating entirely to client-side (rejected as some reports are too large)
  - Enhancing Lambda only (rejected due to timeout limitations)
- **Consequences**: More complex codebase but greater flexibility and performance

#### Decision 2: Direct S3 Access from Browser
- **Choice**: Allow browser to directly fetch CSV files from S3
- **Rationale**: Eliminates Lambda middleman for file retrieval
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Creating a proxy API (rejected due to added complexity)
  - Pre-processing files for smaller downloads (rejected due to maintenance overhead)
- **Consequences**: Better performance but requires proper S3 CORS configuration

#### Decision 3: Special Handling for Default Filters
- **Choice**: Skip discount filtering when default discount IDs are selected
- **Rationale**: Better matches user expectations and prevents confusing empty results
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Complex percentage-to-ID conversion logic (rejected as too brittle)
  - Requiring explicit filter selection (rejected for poor UX)
- **Consequences**: More intuitive filtering behavior at the cost of some technical "purity"

#### Decision 4: Expandable CSV Data Table View
- **Choice**: Implement a toggle for expanding CSV table to show all rows without scrolling
- **Rationale**: Improves data visibility and analysis capabilities while maintaining compact default view
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Permanently expanding the table (rejected for space efficiency)
  - Adding a separate "full view" mode (rejected for simplicity)
  - Complex windowing with virtual scrolling (rejected as overly complex for the use case)
- **Consequences**: Better data visualization while keeping the UI clean with user control over the view

#### Decision 5: Extended Date Range for Client-Side Processing
- **Choice**: Allow date selection up to the current day for client-side processing while maintaining original limits for Lambda
- **Rationale**: Client-side processing can handle more current data without the same limitations as Lambda processing
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Using the same date limits for both methods (rejected as unnecessarily restrictive)
  - Removing date limits entirely (rejected for performance reasons with very large datasets)
- **Consequences**: More flexibility for users while maintaining appropriate constraints based on processing method

### Implementation
1. Created new csvProcessing.ts utility library
2. Implemented client-side file fetching, parsing, and filtering
3. Added UI toggle to switch between processing methods
4. Fixed location filtering to work with discount filters
5. Added special handling for default discount values

### Lessons Learned
1. **Testing Edge Cases**: Filter logic needs explicit testing with percentage values
2. **User Expectation Modeling**: Default filter selections should show "everything"
3. **Hybrid Architecture Benefits**: Client/server hybrid approach provides flexibility
4. **Performance Trade-offs**: Moving processing to the client improves perceived performance

### Impact
- Improved performance for report generation
- Enhanced user experience with immediate data display
- Reduced Lambda execution costs
- Fixed filtering issues for better data exploration
- Established pattern for future client-side processing features

## 2025-03-07: Team Assignment Permission Model Fix

### Problem
Team assignment functionality was failing with permission errors when:
1. Trying to assign a user who has no current team to a team
2. Creating a catch-22 situation where users removed from teams could never be added back

### Investigation
1. Examined client-side error logs showing 403 "Access denied" errors
2. Reviewed server code to understand permission checking logic
3. Traced the execution path in the joinTeam controller
4. Identified flawed permission model that checked target user's permissions instead of requesting user's

### Root Causes
1. **Permission Model Logic Flaw**: The controller was checking if the *target user* had admin privileges
2. **Catch-22 Dependency**: Users without a team cannot have admin privileges (roles are tied to teams)
3. **Inadequate Special Case Handling**: The system had no override for administrative users

### Decision Points

#### Decision 1: Focus on Authenticated User's Permissions
- **Choice**: Check the requesting user's permissions instead of the target user's
- **Rationale**: This eliminates the catch-22 where users without teams can never be added back
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Adding special "teamless" privileges (rejected as it adds complexity)
  - Implementing a temporary team assignment workaround (rejected as a hacky solution)
- **Consequences**: Simplified permission model that works consistently across all scenarios

#### Decision 2: Add Special Admin User Override
- **Choice**: Add specific handling for the 'admin' username to ensure administrative access 
- **Rationale**: Ensures at least one account can always manage teams regardless of permissions
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Using a list of admin usernames (rejected for simplicity)
  - Adding a super-admin flag to users table (rejected to avoid schema changes)
- **Consequences**: Maintains an administrative backdoor while simplifying the permission model

#### Decision 3: Maintain Backward Compatibility
